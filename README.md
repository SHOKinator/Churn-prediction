# Churn-prediction
Welcome to my first machine learning project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a survival prediction model based on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

# About the Project
In this project, I implemented a machine learning model to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic. Predicting survival is a fundamental task in disaster response and emergency planning scenarios. By analyzing various features such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and cabin information, the model aims to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.
